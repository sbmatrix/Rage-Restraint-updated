# RAGE-RESTRAINT
# Make sure to have a webcam available. 
# Our project is intended to help gamers calm down during intense moments of anger and rage during a game. Our program uses machine learning to analyze your face, and the user goes through three levels of rage prevention. At the end, the user simply gets locked out, and everything will return to normal after a timer. This is intended to be enough time for the User to go take a break, or get a drink. Our project intended to allow gamer’s parents to control their raging, and improve their lifestyle. 

# Directions:
# Following this users can act angry or use the photo provided to initiate facial tracking to deploy the “take a breather” or warning signs in order to calm down. Three stages will be deployed: First, a warning will show up on the top right. Then, a sign will come up initiating the gamer to take a breather. Lastly, the screen will lock. Users should press 0 to escape stage 3, when the program locks your entire screen.
